🎯 GOAL:
Design and code UI that is instantly understandable, intuitive, and engaging — the user should never have to guess what to do, even if they are non-technical.

📘 RULES:

1️⃣ SELF-EVIDENT INTERFACE (Norman + Krug)
- Every element must clearly communicate its purpose (affordance & visibility).
- Avoid cleverness — clarity always beats creativity.
- Buttons, links, and icons must include text unless universally recognized.
- Provide consistent feedback for all actions (loading, success, error).

2️⃣ USE CONVENTIONS & CONSISTENCY (Krug + Tidwell)
- Follow familiar patterns: nav placement, buttons, icons, terminology.
- Maintain consistent spacing, color, and typography systems.
- For dashboards: summarize first, allow drill-downs.
- Mobile: prioritize tap targets and easy navigation.

3️⃣ REDUCE COGNITIVE LOAD (Norman + Krug + Laws of UX)
- Limit choices per screen (Hick’s Law).
- Keep memory load minimal (Norman), group items in 5–7 chunks (Miller’s Law).
- Only one main goal per page; highlight hierarchy using typography, spacing, and color.

4️⃣ ENGAGEMENT & USER HABITS (Hooked)
- Use the Hook Model ethically: Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment.
- Reward user progress (badges, stats, subtle feedback).
- Design features to encourage positive engagement without overwhelming the user.

5️⃣ ITERATIVE DESIGN & VALIDATION (Lean UX)
- Start each design with a hypothesis: what problem are we solving?
- Build MVPs and iterate quickly; prioritize outcomes over output.
- Collaborate with developers, designers, and stakeholders during design.
- Validate design with testing, analytics, or user feedback.

6️⃣ NAVIGATION & SCANNABILITY (Krug + Tidwell)
- Navigation must be predictable, persistent, and highlight current location.
- Use meaningful headings, bullet points, and concise text.
- Group related content; separate unrelated content with whitespace.

7️⃣ FEEDBACK, AFFORDANCE & ACCESSIBILITY (Norman + Krug)
- Every action gives immediate visual or audio feedback.
- Confirm completed actions clearly (“Saved!”, “Uploaded!”).
- Buttons disabled during loading to prevent mistakes.
- Contrast meets WCAG AA; interactive elements keyboard-accessible.

8️⃣ DESIGN FOR NON-TECH USERS (UX Fundamentals for Non-UX Professionals)
- Avoid technical jargon; use plain, simple language.
- Make workflows obvious — no prior computer knowledge required.
- Provide hints, tooltips, or onboarding for complex features.

9️⃣ TESTING & ITERATION
- Apply the “3-user testing” mindset: if two users misunderstand, it’s unclear.
- Track user hesitation points and iterate to improve clarity.
- Continuously refine layouts, hierarchy, and interaction patterns.
