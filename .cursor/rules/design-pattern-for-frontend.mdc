🎯 GOAL:
Create UI/UX components and web application code that is **modular, reusable, maintainable, and scalable**, following proven design patterns and modern software principles.

📘 RULES:

1️⃣ **CREATIONAL PATTERNS (Object Creation)**
- **Abstract Factory**: Interface for creating families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separate construction from representation; same process can build different outputs.
- **Factory Method**: Interface for object creation, subclasses decide the concrete type.
- **Prototype**: Clone existing objects to create new instances efficiently.

2️⃣ **STRUCTURAL PATTERNS (Class/Object Composition)**
- **Adapter**: Convert one interface to another expected by clients.
- **Bridge**: Decouple abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite**: Compose objects into tree structures for hierarchical representation.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically add responsibilities to objects.
- **Facade**: Simplify access to complex subsystems.
- **Flyweight**: Share objects for efficiency.
- **Proxy**: Control access to another object.

3️⃣ **BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS (Interactions)**
- **Chain of Responsibility**, **Command**, **Interpreter**, **Iterator**, **Mediator**, **Memento**, **Observer**, **State**, **Strategy**, **Template Method**, **Visitor**.
- Ensure clear object communication and predictable behavior.

4️⃣ **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies into classes via constructor, setter, or interface.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance** to reduce tight coupling.
- **Program to an interface, not an implementation**.
- Encapsulate what varies; isolate change-prone components.

5️⃣ **CODE QUALITY PRINCIPLES**
- **DRY**: Avoid duplication; reuse components and helpers.
- **KISS**: Keep logic simple and readable; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **YAGNI**: Only implement features that are actually needed now.
- **SOLID**: Apply all five principles for maintainable design.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Layer UI, business logic, and data access clearly.
- **Encapsulation**: Protect internal state, expose only necessary interfaces.

6️⃣ **UI/UX INTEGRATION**
- Modular components should respect UX rules: self-evident interface, consistent feedback, hierarchy, accessibility.
- Follow **responsive and mobile-first design** principles.
- Maintain usability patterns like clear navigation, scannable content, and predictable interactions.

7️⃣ **TESTING & MAINTENANCE**
- Write unit tests for all reusable components.
- Use integration tests for subsystems.
- Refactor continuously to improve readability and maintainability without changing behavior.
- Document patterns, decisions, and interfaces for team clarity.

8️⃣ **DOCUMENTATION & COMMUNICATION**
- Use meaningful naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Include UML or diagrams for complex component hierarchies.
- Explain design decisions and chosen patterns to maintain clarity across the team.

9️⃣ **ITERATION & FEEDBACK**
- Continuously gather user feedback and analytics.
- Refactor or update patterns if they no longer fit project needs.
- Encourage collaboration between design, development, and QA teams.
